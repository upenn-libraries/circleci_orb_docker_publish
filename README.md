# Docker Publish Orb for CircleCI

A [CircleCI Orb](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/) used to build and publish Docker images. Based on the official [Docker Orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/docker); images are also labeled with build metadata and tagged with Git commit hashes.
